        <h2>The Concept of Three-way Decision in Rough Set Theory</h2>
        <P>
            The concept of three-way decisions was proposed and used to interpret
            rough set three regions. More specifically, the positive, negative and
            boundary regions are viewed, respectively, as the regions of acceptance,
            rejection, and non-commitment in a ternary classification. The positive and
            negative regions can be used to induce rules of acceptance and rejection;
            whenever it is impossible to make an acceptance or a rejection decision, the
            third non-commitment decision is made. It can be shown that, under certain
            conditions, probabilistic three-way decisions are superior to both Palwak
            three-way decisions and two-way decisions.

        <h2>Pawlak Three-step Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            An information table provides all available information about a set of
            objects. We analyze attributes and objects based on the information functions
            in the table. Pawlak investigated three main tasks of rough set analysis and
            presented them in a sequential three steps. The first step analyzes attribute
            dependencies with an objective to simplify a table. The main tasks involving
            identifying superfluous attributes and finding a minimal subset of attributes
            that preserves the same information as the entire set of attributes for the
            purpose of classification. Such a minimal set of attributes is called an
            attribute reduct of the table or a relative attribute reduct of a classification
            table. There may exist more than one reduct for each table. With respect to a
            reduced table with a minimal set of attributes in a decision table, we can
            construct a set of decision rules. The left-hand-side of each decision rule is a
            conjunction of a set of attribute-value pairs. The second step analyzes
            dependencies of attribute values with an objective to simplify a decision rule.
            Similar to the notion of superfluous attribute in a table, there may exist
            superfluous attribute-value pairs in the left-hand-side of a decision rule. The
            main tasks of the second step are to identify superfluous attribute-value pairs
            and to derive a minimal set of attribute-value pairs for each decision rule. A
            minimal set of attribute-value pairs is called a relative attribute value-pair
            reduct. Again, there may exist more than one reduct. The result of the second
            step is a set of minimal decision rules. The third step analyzes dependencies
            of decision rules with an objective to simplifying a set of decision rules.
            There may exist superfluous rules in the set of decision rules obtained in the
            second step. By removing superfluous rules, one can obtain a minimal set of
            rules called a rule reduct.

        <h2>Three-Way Decisions</h2>
        <p>
            The main ideas of three-way decisions are described in terms of a ternary
            classification according to evaluations of a set of criteria. Suppose U is a
            finite nonempty set of objects or decision alternatives and C is a finite set of
            conditions. Each condition in C may be a criterion, an objective, or a
            constraint. For simplicity, we refer to conditions in C as criteria. Our
            decision task is to classify objects of U according to whether they satisfy the
            set of criteria. In widely used two-way decision models, it is assumed that an
            object either satisfies the criteria or does not satisfy the criteria. The set U is
            divided into two disjoint regions, namely, the positive region POS for
            objects satisfying the criteria and the negative region NEG for objects not
            satisfying the criteria. There are usually some classification errors associated
            with such a binary classification. Two main difficulties with two-way
            approaches are their stringent binary assumption of the satisfiability of
            objects and the requirement of a dichotomous classification. In many
            situations, it may happen that an object only satisfies the set of criteria to
            some degree. Even if an object may actually either satisfy or not satisfy the
            criteria, we may not be able to identify without uncertainty the subset of
            objects that satisfy the criteria due to uncertain or incomplete information.
            Consequently, we are only able to search for an approximate solution.
            Instead of making a binary decision, we use thresholds on the degrees of
            satisfiability to make one of three decisions: (a) accept an object as
            satisfying the set of criteria if its degree of satisfiability is at or above a
            certain level; (b) reject the object by treating it as not satisfying the criteria if
            its degree of satisfiability is at or below another level; and (c) neither accept
            nor reject the object but opt for a non-commitment. The third option may
            also be referred to as a deferment decision that requires further information
            or investigation.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples of Three-Way Decisions</h2>
        <p>
            [Triage] This is a classical example of three-way decisions that was
            used to prioritize treatment of the wounded during war. The basic version of
            triage divides a set of the wounded into three categories:
            1. Those who are likely to live, regardless of what care they receive;
            2. Those who are likely to die no matter what is done for them;
            3. Those for whom immediate care will make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            [Text Analysis] Some of the tasks of text analysis are to identify a set of
            significant words and to determine their significance values. Following the
            pioneer work of Luhn, one can divide a set of words into three regions based
            on their frequencies. Given a pair of a high threshold u and a low threshold l,
            we can divide words into three regions. High-frequency words ranked before
            u and low-frequency words ranked after l are non-significant words, and
            medium-frequency words ranked between u and l are significant words.
            Once the three regions are constructed, one can design strategies to further
            process words in each region.
        </p>
        <p>
            [Management of Students] Many schools, colleges, and universities
            typically monitor student progress based on a three-way classification of
            students. For example, according to GPA (Grade Point Average), one can
            divide students into the groups of high-, medium-, and low- GPA students,
            respectively. A different action is taken for each group of students. A
            high-GPA student may be awarded a scholarship and a low-GPA student may
            receive a warning letter. It is surprising that we seldom question the
            rationales and impacts of these strategies, particularly, the strategy of doing
            nothing for medium-GPA students.
        </p>
        <p>
            [Traffic Lights] In our daily life, we use traffic lights based on a
            three-way classification of conditions. As we know, it has red light, green
            light and yellow light which are three conditions that satisfying the go, stop
            and the medium between go and stop which alerts drivers to make a
            decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            [Marking System] In many universities, professors or TA doing marking
            also uses a three-way decision. For the all correct part, it is in positive region,
            for the all wrong part, it is in negative region, and the medium which has
            correct part but not all correct is in boundary region.

<!-- Information Retrieval -->
<div class="brick">
    <h1>{ Information Retrieval }</h1>
    <p>
        Information retrieval is obtaining information from resources according to need.
        The basic structure of information retrieval can be three main parts: documents,
        users and matching. Documents need representations. Users provide queries.
        Matching combines documents and usersâ€™ queries to provide retrieved
        information. Matching can be classified into two parts: exact matching and
        inexact matching. In exact matching, we have Boolean model. In inexact
        matching, we have vector space model and probabilistic models. Vector spacer
        model includes binary vector space models and weighted vector space models.
        For the results which are retrieved information, we have relevance feedback. It
        contains binary relevance feedback viewing documents as relevant or nonrelevant
        and user preference feedback including perfect ranking and acceptable
        ranking. Relevance feedback as well as system evaluation, they both improve the
        effectiveness and efficiency of the whole information retrieval system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The history of information retrieval originates from file system, then to databases
        and finally to IR system. Further more, information retrieval can reach
        knowledge retrieval. For each of part in the whole structure discussed above, it
        has many models and concepts. In the beginning, we have documents. From
        documents to results, we need indexing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indexing is a transition from external representation like web pages to internal
        representation such as terms. We determine the set of terms by controlled
        vocabulary and uncontrolled vocabulary. Then we have a basic assumption of
        relevant and non-relevant according to if there is a word appears in documents
        with its frequency determining the importance.
    <p>
    <p>
        From indexing, we know terms and frequencies. So, a term to frequency matrix
        can be built which is TM matrix in short. Then we introduce Boolean model with
        binary document representation and Boolean query expression. In order to avoid
        all terms are equally weighted, we need to change TF matrix into a weighted
        matrix. There are many weighted methods: row-wise normalization, columnwise
        normalization, R*C, TF*IDF and so on.
    </p>	
    <p>
        To improve the system, we then have system evaluation. Evaluation is to find
        measures which tell 1. whether a system is good; 2. if one system is better than
        another system. There are three classical measures in binary evaluation:
        precision-based, recall-based and balanced. In user preference system evaluation,
        we then discuss user preference relation, indifference relation, perfect ranking
        and acceptable ranking. The measurement for user preference evaluation can be
        calculated by ndpm. Ndpm classifies the relationship between system and user
        into 3 cases: agree, contradict, compatible which has 0, 2 and 1 credits
        respectively. By calculating the whole sum, we can know the exact matching
        degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        For inexact matching, there is vector space model of information system. In
        vector space model, we have different weighted formula to represent a document,
        cosine similarity and linear retrieval function as well as probability
        interpretations. At last, we introduce relevance feedback. It asks the system learn
        from examples and correct errors by itself to construct a bridge between results
        and documents.
